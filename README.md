This is my attempt of the etch-a-sketch project from The Odin Project's [curriculum.](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)

I understand the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript and DOM manipulation. I will test out my skills with this project and hopefully better understand the concepts I've already learned.


After completing this project I understand more about Javascript and how to manipulate the DOM with it. I also learned about using CSS variables.
